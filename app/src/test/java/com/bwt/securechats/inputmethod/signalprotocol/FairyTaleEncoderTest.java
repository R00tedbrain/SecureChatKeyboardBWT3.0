  public static String rapunzelText = "There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain\n" +
      "wished for a child.  At length the woman hoped that God\n" +
      "was about to grant her desire.  These people had a little\n" +
      "window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden\n" +
      "could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and\n" +
      "herbs.  It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one\n" +
      "dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had\n" +
      "great power and was dreaded by all the world.  One day the woman\n" +
      "was standing by this window and looking down into the garden,\n" +
      "when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful\n" +
      "rampion - rapunzel, and it looked so fresh and green that she\n" +
      "longed for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some.  This desire\n" +
      "increased every day, and as she knew that she could not get any\n" +
      "of it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.\n" +
      "Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, what ails you, dear\n" +
      "wife.  Ah, she replied, if I can\'t eat some of the rampion, which\n" +
      "is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.  The man, who loved\n" +
      "her, thought, sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of\n" +
      "the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.  At twilight, he\n" +
      "clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress,\n" +
      "hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife.  She\n" +
      "at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily.  It tasted\n" +
      "so good to her - so very good, that the next day she longed for it\n" +
      "three times as much as before.  If he was to have any rest, her\n" +
      "husband must once more descend into the garden.  In the gloom of\n" +
      "evening, therefore, he let himself down again.  But when he had\n" +
      "clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the\n" +
      "enchantress standing before him.  How can you dare, said she with\n" +
      "angry look, descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a\n" +
      "thief.  You shall suffer for it.  Ah, answered he, let mercy take\n" +
      "the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of\n" +
      "necessity.  My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such\n" +
      "a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some\n" +
      "to eat.  Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and\n" +
      "said to him, if the case be as you say, I will allow you to take\n" +
      "away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\n" +
      "condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring\n" +
      "into the world.  It shall be well treated, and I will care for it\n" +
      "like a mother.  The man in his terror consented to everything, and\n" +
      "when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once,\n" +
      "gave the child the name of rapunzel, and took it away with her.\n" +
      "Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun.\n" +
      "When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a\n" +
      "tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but\n" +
      "quite at the top was a little window.  When the enchantress\n" +
      "wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried,\n" +
      "     rapunzel, rapunzel,\n" +
      "     let down your hair to me.\n" +
      "Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when\n" +
      "she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided\n" +
      "tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above,\n" +
      "and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed\n" +
      "up by it.\n" +
      "After a year or two, it came to pass that the king\'s son rode\n" +
      "through the forest and passed by the tower.  Then he heard a song,\n" +
      "which was so charming that he stood still and listened.  This was\n" +
      "rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet\n" +
      "voice resound.  The king\'s son wanted to climb up to her, and\n" +
      "looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found.  He\n" +
      "rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that\n" +
      "every day he went out into the forest and listened to it.  Once when\n" +
      "he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress\n" +
      "came there, and he heard how she cried,\n" +
      "     rapunzel, rapunzel,\n" +
      "     let down your hair.\n" +
      "Then rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the\n" +
      "enchantress climbed up to her.  If that is the ladder by which one\n" +
      "mounts, I too will try my fortune, said he, and the next day when\n" +
      "it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried,\n" +
      "     rapunzel, rapunzel,\n" +
      "     let down your hair.\n" +
      "Immediately the hair fell down and the king\'s son climbed up.\n" +
      "At first rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as\n" +
      "her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her.  But the king\'s son\n" +
      "began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his\n" +
      "heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he\n" +
      "had been forced to see her.  Then rapunzel lost her fear, and when\n" +
      "he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that\n" +
      "he was young and handsome, she thought, he will love me more than\n" +
      "old dame gothel does.  And she said yes, and laid her hand in his.\n" +
      "She said, I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know\n" +
      "how to get down.  Bring with you a skein of silk every time that\n" +
      "you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready\n" +
      "I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.  They agreed\n" +
      "that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the\n" +
      "old woman came by day.  The enchantress remarked nothing of\n" +
      "this, until once rapunzel said to her, tell me, dame gothel, how\n" +
      "it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than\n" +
      "the young king\'s son - he is with me in a moment.  Ah. You\n" +
      "wicked child, cried the enchantress.  What do I hear you say.  I\n" +
      "thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have\n" +
      "deceived me.  In her anger she clutched rapunzel\'s beautiful\n" +
      "tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of\n" +
      "scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the\n" +
      "lovely braids lay on the ground.  And she was so pitiless that she\n" +
      "took poor rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great\n" +
      "grief and misery.\n" +
      "On the same day that she cast out rapunzel, however, the\n" +
      "enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to\n" +
      "the hook of the window, and when the king\'s son came and cried,\n" +
      "     rapunzel, rapunzel,\n" +
      "     let down your hair,\n" +
      "she let the hair down.  The king\'s son ascended, but instead of\n" +
      "finding his dearest rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed\n" +
      "at him with wicked and venomous looks.  Aha, she cried mockingly,\n" +
      "you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits\n" +
      "no longer singing in the nest.  The cat has got it, and will scratch\n" +
      "out your eyes as well.  Rapunzel is lost to you.  You will never see\n" +
      "her again.  The king\'s son was beside himself with pain, and in\n" +
      "his despair he leapt down from the tower.  He escaped with his life,\n" +
      "but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes.  Then he\n" +
      "wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and\n" +
      "berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his\n" +
      "dearest wife.  Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at\n" +
      "length came to the desert where rapunzel, with the twins to which\n" +
      "she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness.  He\n" +
      "heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards\n" +
      "it, and when he approached, rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck\n" +
      "and wept.  Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear\n" +
      "again, and he could see with them as before.  He led her to his\n" +
      "kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long\n" +
      "time afterwards, happy and contented.";

      "cinderella had jumped quickly down from the back of the pigeon-house\n" +

      "which hung the most magnificent pears.  She clambered so nimbly\n" +
      "between the branches like a squirrel that the king\'s son did not\n" +
      "know where she was gone.  He waited until her father came, and\n" +
      "said to him, the unknown maiden has escaped from me, and I\n" +
      "believe she has climbed up the pear-tree.  The father thought,\n" +
      "can it be cinderella.  And had an axe brought and cut the\n" +
      "tree down, but no one was on it.  And when they got into the\n" +
      "kitchen, cinderella lay there among the ashes, as usual, for she\n" +
      "had jumped down on the other side of the tree, had taken the\n" +
      "beautiful dress to the bird on the little hazel-tree, and put on her\n" +
      "grey gown.\n" +
      "On the third day, when the parents and sisters had gone away,\n" +
      "cinderella went once more to her mother\'s grave and said to the\n" +
      "little tree -\n" +
      "     shiver and quiver, my little tree,\n" +
      "     silver and gold throw down over me.\n" +
      "And now the bird threw down to her a dress which was more\n" +
      "splendid and magnificent than any she had yet had, and the\n" +
      "slippers were golden.  And when she went to the festival in the\n" +
      "dress, no one knew how to speak for astonishment.  The king\'s son\n" +
      "danced with her only, and if any one invited her to dance, he said\n" +
      "this is my partner.\n" +
      "When evening came, cinderella wished to leave, and the king\'s\n" +
      "son was anxious to go with her, but she escaped from him so quickly\n" +
      "that he could not follow her.  The king\'s son, however, had\n" +
      "employed a ruse, and had caused the whole staircase to be smeared\n" +
      "with pitch, and there, when she ran down, had the maiden\'s left\n" +
      "slipper remained stuck.  The king\'s son picked it up, and it was\n" +
      "small and dainty, and all golden.  Next morning, he went with it to\n" +
      "the father, and said to him, no one shall be my wife but she whose\n" +
      "foot this golden slipper fits.  Then were the two sisters glad,\n" +
      "for they had pretty feet.  The eldest went with the shoe into her\n" +
      "room and wanted to try it on, and her mother stood by.  But she\n" +
      "could not get her big toe into it, and the shoe was too small for\n" +
      "her.  Then her mother gave her a knife and said, cut the toe off,\n" +
      "when you are queen you will have no more need to go on foot.  The\n" +
      "maiden cut the toe off, forced the foot into the shoe, swallowed\n" +
      "the pain, and went out to the king\'s son.  Then he took her on his\n" +
      "his horse as his bride and rode away with her.  They were\n" +
      "obliged, however, to pass the grave, and there, on the hazel-tree,\n" +
      "sat the two pigeons and cried -\n" +
      "     turn and peep, turn and peep,\n" +
      "     there\'s blood within the shoe,\n" +
      "     the shoe it is too small for her,\n" +
      "     the true bride waits for you.\n" +
      "Then he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was trickling\n" +
      "from it.  He turned his horse round and took the false bride\n" +
      "home again, and said she was not the true one, and that the\n" +
      "other sister was to put the shoe on.  Then this one went into her\n" +
      "chamber and got her toes safely into the shoe, but her heel was\n" +
      "too large.  So her mother gave her a knife and said,  cut a bit\n" +
      "off your heel, when you are queen you will have no more need\n" +
      "to go on foot.  The maiden cut a bit off her heel, forced\n" +
      "her foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the\n" +
      "king\'s son.  He took her on his horse as his bride, and rode away\n" +
      "with her, but when they passed by the hazel-tree, the two pigeons\n" +
      "sat on it and cried -\n" +
      "     turn and peep, turn and peep,\n" +
      "     there\'s blood within the shoe,\n" +
      "     the shoe it is too small for her,\n" +
      "     the true bride waits for you.\n" +
      "He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running\n" +
      "out of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking quite\n" +
      "red.  Then he turned his horse and took the false bride home\n" +
      "again.  This also is not the right one, said he, have you no\n" +
      "other daughter.  No, said the man, there is still a little\n" +
      "stunted kitchen-wench which my late wife left behind her, but\n" +
      "she cannot possibly be the bride.  The king\'s son said he was\n" +
      "to send her up to him, but the mother answered, oh, no, she is\n" +
      "much too dirty, she cannot show herself.  But he absolutely\n" +
      "insisted on it, and cinderella had to be called.  She first\n" +
      "washed her hands and face clean, and then went and bowed down\n" +
      "before the king\'s son, who gave her the golden shoe.  Then she\n" +
      "seated herself on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy\n" +
      "wooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, which fitted like a\n" +
      "glove.  And when she rose up and the king\'s son looked at her\n" +
      "face he recognized the beautiful maiden who had danced with\n" +
      "him and cried, that is the true bride.  The step-mother and\n" +
      "the two sisters were horrified and became pale with rage, he,\n" +
      "however, took cinderella on his horse and rode away with her.  As\n" +
      "they passed by the hazel-tree, the two white doves cried -\n" +
      "     turn and peep, turn and peep,\n" +
      "     no blood is in the shoe,\n" +
      "     the shoe is not too small for her,\n" +
      "     the true bride rides with you,\n" +
      "and when they had cried that, the two came flying down and\n" +
      "placed themselves on cinderella\'s shoulders, one on the right,\n" +
      "the other on the left, and remained sitting there.\n" +
      "When the wedding with the king\'s son was to be celebrated, the\n" +
      "two false sisters came and wanted to get into favor with\n" +
      "cinderella and share her good fortune.  When the betrothed\n" +
      "couple went to church, the elder was at the right side and the\n" +
      "younger at the left, and the pigeons pecked out one eye from\n" +
      "each of them.  Afterwards as they came back the elder was at\n" +
      "the left, and the younger at the right, and then the pigeons\n" +
      "pecked out the other eye from each.  And thus, for their\n" +
      "wickedness and falsehood, they were punished with blindness\n" +
      "all their days.";
